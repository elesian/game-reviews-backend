## Working Demo

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimick the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

Your database will be PSQL, and you will interact with it using [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/).

### **STOP POINT: Hosting and README!**

- If you _have_ already hosted your app at this point, remember to push up to `heroku` your updated code
- If you haven't already hosted your app, now is the time! Follow the instructions in [hosting.md](./hosting.md)
- Write your README, including the following information:
  - [ ] Link to hosted version
  - [ ] Write a summary of what the project is
  - [ ] Provide clear instructions of how to clone, install dependencies, seed local database, and run tests
  - [ ] Include information about how to create the two `.env` files
  - [ ] Specify minimum versions of `Node.js` and `Postgres` needed to run the project

**Remember that this README is targetted at people who will come to your repo (potentially from your CV or portfolio website) and want to see what you have created, and try it out for themselves(not _just_ to look at your code!). So it is really important to include a link to the hosted version, as well as implement the above `GET /api` endpoint so that it is clear what your api does.**
